# Advent of Code (2017!)

My solutions for the [2017 Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017/) programming puzzles.

I started these puzzles post-competition as a means to start learning Scala over the holiday, and likewise to get practice injecting functional patterns into my code. The project structure is based off [my brother's AoC foray](https://github.com/kevinavery/advent-of-code) a couple years ago. This was a learning endeavor, but I like to keep things somewhat presentable (as hopefully suggested by the sheepish unit tests and modularity). Still, you might find evidence of toying with new/different ideas, as well as added Christmas cheer.
